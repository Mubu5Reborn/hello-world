# hello-world
My first repository based on the Hello World Github guide


Hi! My name is Mubu Mubu. I would like to pursue a programming career but I'm open to working in other non-software jobs.
I enjoy learning and would like for learning to be present in everything I do hence me following this guide.

I currently have experience programming in C and Java.
